## Intro
There is a simple logger class located in logger.js that needs tests written and cleaned up.  
Clean up logger.js as you see fit and add tests to test/logger.js to validate the features shown in useLogger.js.

Add any review comments about the code to the notes file.

Plese do not overthink this, it should not take more than a few hours.
