## Changes Made

Installed AirBnB eslint module and fixed all linting issues according to that standard.

Ignored the test path for linting due to many issues with functions and unreferenced
variables like 'describe' and 'it'.  Mocha also recommends NOT using arrow functions
for its tests.

Removed many object-scoped (this dot) variables in the logger as possible.

Moved the colorizing of the message from the transport function to the format function.

Utilitzed constants for the log levels rather than hard-coded strings.

Moved if/then/else logic for selecting color to a switch statement.
